# PROJET_GMD
Projet GMD 2017 (réalisation d'un système d'intégration de données biomédicales)

This project is the final project of the "Gestion de masses de données" course.
This project is Biomedical data integration system. 
Different types of databases such as couchDB, MySQL or CSV files are aggregated.
Given symptoms, the system will find corresponding causes. Those can either be drug side effects or diseases symptoms.
Given symptoms, it will also find the possible treatments.

To run it some of the databases have to be present locally on the computer.
If the necessary resources are present launching the "ProjetGMD.jar" file will launch the application.
Entering symptoms in the search bar will then bring the aforementioned results.
